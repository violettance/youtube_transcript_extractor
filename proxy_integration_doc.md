# YouTube Transcript Extractor - Proxy Integration Documentation

## YouTube IP Blocking Issue

YouTube blocks API requests from cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.). As a result, applications running in cloud environments may encounter 'IP blocking' errors when using the YouTube Transcript API.

## Proxy Integration Solution

You can bypass YouTube's IP restrictions by using proxy servers. Below are methods for adding proxy support to the application.

### 1. Using Proxies with the Requests Library

```python
import requests
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

# Proxy settings
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy_server_address:port',
    'https': 'https://proxy_server_address:port'
}

# Create a requests session
session = requests.Session()
session.proxies.update(proxies)

# Inject the proxies into YouTubeTranscriptApi
YouTubeTranscriptApi._http_client.proxies = proxies
```

### 2. Using Third-Party Proxy Services

You can use one of the following proxy services:

- **Free Proxy List**: [https://free-proxy-list.net/](https://free-proxy-list.net/)
- **ProxyScrape**: [https://proxyscrape.com/](https://proxyscrape.com/)
- **Proxy Rotation Services**: Luminati, Smartproxy, Oxylabs, etc.

### 3. Implementing Proxy Rotation

Since a single proxy IP may eventually get blocked, implementing proxy rotation is more effective:

```python
import random
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

# Proxy list
proxy_list = [
    {'http': 'http://proxy1:port1', 'https': 'https://proxy1:port1'},
    {'http': 'http://proxy2:port2', 'https': 'https://proxy2:port2'},
    # Add more proxies
]

def get_transcript_with_proxy_rotation(video_id, language='en'):
    random.shuffle(proxy_list)
    for proxy in proxy_list:
        try:
            YouTubeTranscriptApi._http_client.proxies = proxy
            transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id, languages=[language])
            return transcript
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error with proxy {proxy}: {str(e)}")
            continue
    raise Exception("All proxies failed")
```

## Risks and Disadvantages of Using Proxies

1. **Performance**: Proxy usage may be slower than direct connections.
2. **Reliability**: Free proxies may frequently stop working or be slow.
3. **Security**: Especially free proxies can pose security risks.
4. **Cost**: Reliable and fast proxy services are usually paid.
5. **Maintenance**: Proxy lists may need regular updates.

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Local Installation**: Running the application on your own computer is the simplest solution.
2. **YouTube Data API**: You can access subtitles using the official YouTube Data API, but it requires an API key and has quota limits.
3. **Web Scraping**: Tools like Selenium can be used to scrape subtitles directly from YouTube pages, but this may violate YouTube's terms of service.

## Conclusion

While proxy integration is technically possible, it comes with challenges in terms of user experience, reliability, and maintenance. Running the application locally is the most practical way to avoid these issues.
